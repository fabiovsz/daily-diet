# Daily Diet 🥪

## Project Details

Daily diet is an API that is designed for user management and the logging of meals associated with those users. The API has been developed to streamline the creation and maintenance of information related to dietary habits, allowing users to record their meals and monitor whether they adhere to their diet.

This project was developed using ASP.NET in order to practicing the concepts of CRUD operations, software architecture, C#, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, SQLServer, REST API best practices and dependency management.

The project is also part of one of the challenges proposed by [Rocketseat](www.rocketseat.com.br) for the Node Ignite course journey and adapted by me to ASP.NET.

## API Documentation

The API documentation with all requests was provided by Swagger, that is included in the ASP.NET.

## Usage Instructions

- Clone the repository.
